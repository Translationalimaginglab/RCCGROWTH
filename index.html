                        This study aimed to classify the growth rates of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) in patients with Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome using a machine learning system based on MRI and clinical characteristics. 128 lesions in 55 VHL patients were analyzed from 2015 to 2021. A decision tree was created using Python's Scikit-learn library, and the model with the best accuracy was chosen from 200 random data splits.

                    <p>
                        The best model had an accuracy rate of 78% based on the second reader's responses, a weighted positive predictive value of 81%, and a sensitivity of 78%. Diffusion restriction and T2 signal intensity were the two most important features. The study demonstrated high accuracy in classifying the rapid vs. slow growth rate of VHL-associated kidney tumors based on clinical variables and imaging features from a single MRI assessment. The inter-reader reliability for the majority of imaging properties was rated as moderate to excellent.

                        This approach enables more targeted active monitoring and needs external validation, particularly for sporadic lesions suspected of becoming ccRCC, for which active monitoring is proposed.
